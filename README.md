## Overview
This repository is designed for Machine Learning practitioners who want to streamline their workflows and automate common tasks. It includes:
- **Custom ML Model Libraries**: Simplified implementations for tasks like anomaly detection, real-time predictions, and NLP tasks.
- **AutoML Tools**: An automated pipeline to select, train, and tune models based on the dataset.
- **Flexible Design**: The library can be extended for additional models and tools based on your requirements.

## Features
- **Anomaly Detection Model**: Implements the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in your data.
- **Real-Time Prediction Model**: A flexible model for performing real-time predictions using regression algorithms.
- **AutoML Pipeline**: Automatically selects, trains, and tunes the best model for the given dataset.
- **Easy-to-use API**: Predefined functions and classes to interact with the models.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale for large datasets and real-time use cases.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and set up the environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Srinivas26k/ml-library.git

# Change directory into the project
cd ml-library

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv ml-library-env

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
ml-library-env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source ml-library-env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies:
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms.
- `pandas`: Data manipulation.
- `numpy`: Numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: Visualization tools.
- `tensorflow`: For deep learning models (if applicable).

## Usage

### Anomaly Detection Model
This model uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in the dataset. It is useful for detecting outliers in large datasets.

```python
from ml_library.models.anomaly_detection import AnomalyDetector
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Initialize and train the model
model = AnomalyDetector()
model.fit(data)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(data)

# Output results
print("Anomaly Detection Predictions:", predictions)
```

### Real-Time Prediction Model
This model allows you to make real-time predictions using a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor). It can be used for applications requiring immediate model inference.

```python
from ml_library.models.real_time_prediction import RealTimePredictor
import numpy as np

# Example input for prediction
input_data = np.array([[5.0, 3.5, 1.5, 0.2]])

# Initialize and make a prediction
predictor = RealTimePredictor()
prediction = predictor.predict(input_data)

# Output the prediction
print(f"Prediction for {input_data}: {prediction}")
```

### AutoML Pipeline
This tool automates model selection, training, and hyperparameter tuning based on the dataset. It helps to quickly find the best model for your task.

```python
from ml_library.tools.automl import AutoMLPipeline
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Initialize the AutoML pipeline
pipeline = AutoMLPipeline()

# Fit the pipeline to the data
best_model, best_score = pipeline.fit(data)

# Output the best model and its score
print("Best Model:", best_model)
print("Best Score:", best_score)
```

## Testing
You can run tests for your models using the built-in test files. Tests are designed to ensure the models are functioning as expected.

### Run Tests:
Use unittest to run all the tests.

```bash
# Run the tests
python -m unittest discover tests/
```

### Test Coverage:
Ensure all core features (anomaly detection, real-time predictions, AutoML pipeline) are well-covered with unit tests.
